Today, we celebrate the birthday of an outstanding statesman, a visionary, consistent, loyal and enigmatic master strategist and our President-Elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu  @officialABAT .   On behalf of my darling wife, Ibijoke, and the good people of Lagos State, as well as leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), I wish the incoming President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria a happy 71st birthday.  At 71, Asiwaju has attained the age where what matters most is legacy and God has blessed him with a great opportunity to take the mantle of leadership of Nigeria, and chart the right path of progress for our people.  Asiwaju Tinubu has donated the greater part of his adult life for service to humanity, Lagos State and Nigeria. His many contributions to democracy and good governance have helped the political and democratic trajectory of Nigeria since 1999. It is also on record that he stood firmly on the side of the Nigerian people, even at the risk of losing his life and personal belongings during the dark days of the military junta.  In the political history of Nigeria, Asiwaju will forever be a reference point. He has made and redefined the socio-political history of Nigeria by contributing his quota to the survival of democracy and uninterrupted civilian administration in Nigeria for 24 years.   His emergence as President-Elect is a reward for his hard work and contributions to the country based on his political astuteness, courage, and sagacity.  As he celebrates his 71st birthday, we wish him all the love and care in the world and pray that God will continue to give him wisdom, knowledge and sound health that he will use to steer the ship of the country and navigate Nigeria’s development to the desired place as he becomes Nigeria’s President from May 29, 2023.	normal

Thank you Lagosians!  I am deeply humbled and grateful for the overwhelming support and trust of the good people of Lagos State. I am honored to be re-elected as your Governor and pledge to continue to work tirelessly to deliver a better Lagos for all.   Thank you for believing in me.   I have personally penned my thoughts in a letter to you. I hope you read it and truly feel my passion for Lagos and for you: https://bit.ly/JideSanwoolu  These elections have deeply tested us as a people. This victory is not just mine, but it belongs to every Lagosian.   I have worked hard to live up to this responsibility of governing the most important subnational economy in Africa. We certainly could not have done this by ourselves. Thank you to the Almighty God and all of Lagos. Immense gratitude goes to our great party, APC, and our President-Elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.  Thank you to the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for your commitment to leaving a legacy of fairness and electoral outcomes that reflect the will of the people.   Thank you to my wife, Ibijoke, my Deputy Governor, Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, and all fellow contestants for their contributions. Lagos has chosen competence and experience, on this march to true greatness.   During the course of the campaign, we sadly saw a lot of divisive rhetoric used. Elections should be about capacity, competence, and experience, not ethnicity or religion.  I salute those who refused to be divided by hateful and hurtful ethnic profiling. Recent skirmishes in some LGAs resulting in injuries are reprehensible and not reflective of who we are. Law enforcement and security agencies have been directed to ensure that those found culpable face the full wrath of the law.  Very importantly, and this cannot be overemphasized: What unites us as Lagosians is far more important and substantial than whatever differences exist among us.   As your Governor, I will do everything in my power to ensure that genuine healing takes place. We will continue to run an inclusive government, that delivers for all the people of Lagos, wherever in the State they may be living.   The true Lagos spirit is a welcoming, embracing, liberal one, not a divisive, exclusionary one. In the days and weeks and months ahead, we will continue to do everything to demonstrate and amplify this.  We must reaffirm the spirit of solidarity and togetherness that binds us as Lagosians.   Our work will continue, and there will be no break. The dividends of democracy must continue to be delivered.  Thank you once again dear Lagosians.   Igbega Ipinle Eko, Ajumose Ni O!	normal

Good morning Lagos.  A few days ago, President  @MBuhari  signed bills granting states more autonomy in key areas like electricity, railways, and the judiciary, empowering Lagos to take charge of our own growth.   Thank you, Mr. President.  The Constitutional Alteration Bill No. 33 is a historic move that grants us authority to regulate electricity generation, transmission and distribution.   This will create a Lagos Electricity Market, leading to increased access to electricity, investments and job opportunities.  The new bills will promote efficiency, leading to better service delivery. We've been preparing for this by launching an Electricity Policy, publishing our off-grid strategy, presenting our Integrated Resource Plan and drafting a law to establish the Lagos Electricity Market.  We're committed to achieving 1GW of solar energy in Lagos by 2030 and have engaged with the World Bank for suitable funding. With the creation of the Lagos Electricity Market, we'll fulfill our potential as Africa's model mega city.   The devolution of powers for railways under the Constitution Fifth Alteration Bill No. 32 is a significant move for promoting local economic growth and development. It'll open up investment opportunities and improve the transportation of goods and services.  I'm excited about the next few years as Lagos takes more responsibility for our growth and the fulfillment of our potentials.  Let's work together to make Lagos the best it can be!	normal

Dear Lagosians,  As we observe Good Friday today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices that were made for us and to extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your families.  This day reminds us of the immense love Jesus Christ has for us all, as he gave up his life on the cross for our sins. His selfless act teaches us the importance of putting others before ourselves, of serving with humility and compassion, and of striving to create a better world for all.  Let us be mindful of our collective responsibility to protect ourselves and our loved ones, to be kind and considerate to those around us, and to always hold fast to our faith and hope in the face of adversity.  On behalf of the Lagos State Government, I wish you all a blessed and peaceful Good Friday.  God bless Lagos State, and God bless Nigeria.	normal
